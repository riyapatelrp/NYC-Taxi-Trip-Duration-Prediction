# NYC-Taxi-Trip-Duration-Prediction
The NYC taxi trip time prediction project involves building a machine learning model to predict the time it takes for a taxi to travel from one location to another in New York City. The model takes into account various factors such as traffic conditions, weather, time of day, and origin-destination pairs to make its predictions.
